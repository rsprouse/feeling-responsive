<br>Berkeley graduate students (in any department) are invited to apply for funding for linguistic fieldwork on endangered languages. This funding comes through the Robert L. Oswalt Graduate Student Support Endowment for Endangered Language Documentation, given in memory of Robert L. Oswalt (Ph.D. UC Berkeley 1961) by his widow and sons. It is restricted to Berkeley graduate students, for linguistic fieldwork on endangered languages (anywhere in the world). <br>
