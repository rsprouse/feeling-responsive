The traditional Mojave language area is along the Colorado River from Black Canyon in the north through the Mohave Valley and into the Chemehuevi Valley to the south. Beginning in the 19th century, Mojave expanded along the Colorado River to the present-day towns of Blythe, California and Ehrenberg, Arizona. In pre-contact times, there were an estimated 3,000 speakers (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are fewer than 100 first-language speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Weinberg &amp; Penfield 2000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279440696_Mohave_Language_Planning_Where_Has_It_Been_and_Where_Should_It_Go_from_Here)). Mojave (also written "Mohave") is a member of the Yuman language family. Within Yuman, it is most closely related to [Maricopa](maricopa.html) and [Quechan](quechan.html), and more distantly to Cocopa (spoken in pre-contact times around the Colorado River Delta in Mexico), Kiliwa (spoken in Baja California),  [Kumeyaay](kumeyaay.html), Pai (spoken in Arizona), and Paipai (spoken in Baja California). Together, the Yuman languages comprise one branch of the hypothesized Hokan language family, the other members of which are [Chimariko](chimariko.html), [Esselen](esselen.html), [Karuk](karuk.html), the Palaihnihan languages ([Achumawi](achumawi.html) and [Atsugewi](atsugewi.html)), the Pomoan languages ([Central Pomo](central-pomo.html), [Eastern Pomo](eastern-pomo.html), [Kashaya](kashaya.html), [Northeastern Pomo](northeastern-pomo.html), [Northern Pomo](northern-pomo.html), [Southeastern Pomo](southeastern-pomo.html), and [Southern Pomo](southern-pomo.html)), [Salinan](salinan.html), the Shastan languages ([Konomihu](konomihu.html), [New River Shasta](new-river-shasta.html), [Okwanuchu](okwanuchu.html), and [Shasta](shasta.html)), [Washo](washo.html), and [Yana](yana.html).
