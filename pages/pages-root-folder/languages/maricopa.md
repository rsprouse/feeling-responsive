Before the 18th century, the Maricopa language was spoken along the Colorado River between [Mojave](mojave.html) to the north and [Quechan](quechan.html) to the south. Maricopa speakers were subsequently displaced to the Gila River, southwest of Phonenix, Arizona. The last group of Maricopa to move into Arizona were the Halchidhoma, who resided originally around what is today Blythe, California. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 2,000 to 30,00 speakers of Maricopa (Harwell and Kelly 1983). Today, there are around 100 speakers (Golla 2011), and tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Shepard, 2006](https://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_shepherd/4/)). Maricopa (also called "Piipaash") is a member of the Yuman language family. Within Yuman, it is most closely related to [Mojave](mojave.html) and [Quechan](quechan.html), and more distantly to Cocopa (spoken in pre-contact times around the Colorado River Delta in Mexico), Kiliwa (spoken in Baja California),  [Kumeyaay](kumeyaay.html), Pai (spoken in Arizona), and Paipai (spoken in Baja California). Together, the Yuman languages comprise one branch of the hypothesized Hokan language family, the other members of which are  [Chimariko](chimariko.html), [Esselen](esselen.html), [Karuk](karuk.html), the Palaihnihan languages ([Achumawi](achumawi.html) and [Atsugewi](atsugewi.html)), the Pomoan languages ([Central Pomo](central-pomo.html), [Eastern Pomo](eastern-pomo.html), [Kashaya](kashaya.html), [Northeastern Pomo](northeastern-pomo.html), [Northern Pomo](northern-pomo.html), [Southeastern Pomo](southeastern-pomo.html), and [Southern Pomo](southern-pomo.html)), [Salinan](salinan.html), the Shastan languages ([Konomihu](konomihu.html), [New River Shasta](new-river-shasta.html), [Okwanuchu](okwanuchu.html), and [Shasta](shasta.html)), [Washo](washo.html), and [Yana](yana.html).
