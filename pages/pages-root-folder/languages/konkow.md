The traditional Konkow language area is along the Feather River and surrounding areas from 20 miles south of Oroville into the Sierra Nevada foothills, including the lower part of the Feather River Canyon. It is unclear whether another language, spoken along the Sacramento River from Vina to Butte City and east to Chico — and attested solely in a number of vocabularies —, is a variety of Konkow or a separate, but related, language. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 9,000 speakers of Konkow, [Maidu](maidu.html), and [Nisenan](nisenan.html) together (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are only a few speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing [language revitalization and reclamation](http://maidu.org/about.html). Konkow (also called Koyoomk'awi and Northwest Maidu) is a member of the Maiduan language family, the other members of which are [Maidu](maidu.html) and [Nisenan](nisenan.html). Together, the Maiduan languages form one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family. This groups also includes [Klamath-Modoc](modoc.html), the Miwokan languages ([Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Northern Sierra Miwok](northern-sierra-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), [Saclan](saclan.html), and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html)), the Ohlone languages ([Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Ramaytush](ramaytush.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Tamyen](tamyen.html)), the Wintuan languages ([Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), [Patwin](patwin.html), and [Wintu](wintu.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
