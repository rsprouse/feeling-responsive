The traditional Northern Sierra Miwok language area is in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada along the upper Mokelumne and Calaveras Rivers and along the south fork of the Cosumnes River. In pre-contact times, there were an estimated 19,500 speakers of [Saclan](saclan.html), [Plains](plains-miwok.html), [Central](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Lake](lake-miwok.html), [Southern](southern-sierra-miwok.html), and Northern Sierra Miwok together (Levy 1978). In the 21st century, Northern Sierra Miwok has fewer than a dozen speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing [language revitalization and reclamation](http://newsfromnativecalifornia.com/miwoklanguage/). Northern Sierra Miwok is a Miwokan language, most closely related to [Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html) and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html). The others members of this family are [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), and [Saclan](saclan.html). The Miwokan languages comprise one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family, within which they form a subgroup with the Ohlone languages ([Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Ramaytush](ramaytush.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Tamyen](tamyen.html)). Penutian includes, in addition, [Klamath-Modoc](modoc.html), the Maiduan languages ([Konkow](konkow.html), [Maidu](maidu.html), and [Nisenan](nisenan.html)), the Wintuan languages ([Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), [Patwin](patwin.html), and [Wintu](wintu.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
