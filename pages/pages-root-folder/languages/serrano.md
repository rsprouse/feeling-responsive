The traditional Serrano language area is in the San Bernadino Mountains and the adjacent regions of the Mojave Desert. (Vanyume, a related language, was spoken to the north.) In pre-contact times, there were probably no more than 1,500 speakers of Serrano (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there is only one known first-language speaker (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization, and Serrano language courses began at California State San Bernandino in 2013. Serrano is a member of the Takic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Within Takic, it is most closely related to [Cahuilla](cahuilla.html), [Cupeño](cupeno.html), and [Luiseño](luiseno.html), and more distantly to [Gabrielino](gabrielino.html), [Kitanemuk](kitanemuk.html), [Serrano](serrano.html), and [Tataviam](tataviam.html). The other Uto-Aztecan languages of California are [Tubatulabal](tubatulabal.html) and the Numic languages ([Chemehuevi](chemehuevi.html)-Southern Paiute-Ute, Comanche, [Kawaiisu](kawaiisu.html), [Mono](mono.html), [Northern Paiute](northern-paiute.html), [Panamint](panamint.html), and Shoshone).
