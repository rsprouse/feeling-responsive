The traditional Ramaytush language area is on the San Francisco peninsula as far south as Palo Alto and Pescadero. It may also have been spoken immediately north of the Golden Gate Bridge. During the mission period, Ramaytush was spoken at Mission Dolores. Ramaytush is only attested in a few wordlists. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 1,400 speakers of Ramaytush (Levy 1978). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing [language revitalization and reclamation](https://www.ramaytush.com/about.html).

Ramaytush is an Ohlone (or "Costanoan") language, along with [Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Tamyen](tamyen.html). The Ohlone languages comprise one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family, within which they form a subgroup with the Miwokan languages ([Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Northern Sierra Miwok](northern-sierra-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), [Saclan](saclan.html), and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html)). Penutian also includes Klamath-[Modoc](modoc.html), the Maiduan languages ([Konkow](konkow.html), [Maidu](maidu.html), and [Nisenan](nisenan.html)), the Wintuan languages ([Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), [Patwin](patwin.html), and [Wintu](wintu.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
