The traditional Nisenan language area is throughout the American, Bear, and Yuba River drainages, from where those rivers met the Sacramento River to their headwaters in the Sierra Nevada. There were four major dialect groups: *Valley Nisenan*, spoken along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers and along the lower American River; *Northern Hill Nisenan*, spoken along the middle and upper Yuba River; *Central Hill Nisenan*, spoken on the North and Middle Forks of the American River; and *Southern Hill Nisenan*, spoken from the South Fork of the American River to the North and Middle Forks of the Cosumnnes River. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 9,000 speakers of [Konkow](konkow.html), [Maidu](maidu.html), and Nisenan together (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are no first-language speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Tatsch 2006](http://www.indigenouspolicy.org/index.html/ipj/thesis/view/263)). Nisenan is a member of the Maiduan language family, the other members of which are [Konkow](konkow.html) and [Maidu](maidu.html). Together, the Maiduan languages form one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family. This groups also includes [Klamath-Modoc](modoc.html), the Miwokan languages ([Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Northern Sierra Miwok](northern-sierra-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), [Saclan](saclan.html), and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html)), the Ohlone languages ([Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Ramaytush](ramaytush.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Tamyen](tamyen.html)), the Wintuan languages ([Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), [Patwin](patwin.html), and [Wintu](wintu.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
