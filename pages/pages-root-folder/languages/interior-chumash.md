Languages related to the other Chumashan languages ([Barbareño](barbareno.html), [Samala (Ineseño)](ineseno.html), [Island Chumash](island-chumash.html), [Obispeño](obispeno.html), [Purisimeño](purisimeno.html), and [Ventureño](ventureno.html)) were spoken further inland, though little or nothing is known about them. *Cuyama* was spoken along the Cuyama and Sisquoc Rivers and to the north in the San Joaquin Valley. *Emigdiano* — which is attested solely in placenames — was spoken at San Emigdio near Buena Vista Lake. This latter language has been shown to be a variety of Barbareño, influenced by [Buena Vista Yokuts](yokuts.html) (Beeler and Klar 1977). While difficult to estimate, there were perhaps over 1,000 speakers of Cumaya and several hundred of Emigdiano (Grant 1978).
