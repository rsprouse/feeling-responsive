There are three main varieties of the Panamint language: the western variety (also called "Coso"), traditional to Owens Lake, in the Coso mountains, and in Panamint Valley; the central variety (also called "Timbisha" or "Tümpisa Shoshone"), traditional to Death Valley; and the eastern variety, traditional to Grapevine Canyon, the Funeral Range, and near Beatty. In pre-contact times, there were probably no more than 500 speakers of Panamint (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are no more than two dozen first-language speakers, mostly of the central variety (Golla 2011). Panamint is a member of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Within Numic, it is most closely related to Shoshone (spoken throughout Nevada, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming) and Comanche (spoken mainly in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arizona). It is more distantly related to [Northern Paiute](northern-paiute.html), [Mono](mono.html), [Kawaiisu](kawaiisu.html), and [Chemehuevi](chemehuevi.html)-Southern Paiute-Ute. The other Uto-Aztecan languages of California are [Tubatulabal](tubatulabal.html) and the Takic languages ([Cahuilla](cahuilla.html), [Cupeño](cupeno.html), [Gabrielino](gabrielino.html), [Juaneño](juaneno.html), [Kitanemuk](kitanemuk.html), [Luiseño](luiseno.html), [Serrano](serrano.html), and [Tataviam](tataviam.html)).
