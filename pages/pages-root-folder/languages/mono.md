The traditional Mono language area is from Mono Lake in eastern California to the south and west. Most linguists distinguish two main varieties of the language: *Eastern Mono* (also called "Owens Valley Paiute") is spoken in the Owens River Valley; *Western Mono* (also called "Monachi") is spoken on the western side of the Sierra Nevada, in the San Joaquin River, Kings River, and Kaweah River watersheds. In pre-contact times, there were 3,000 to 4,000 speakers of Mono, by conservative estimates (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are no more than 40 first-language speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Kroskrity 2018](https://escholarship.org/content/qt4h56h7jb/qt4h56h7jb_noSplash_cd67e0da8f6275abdb44ac75987200ad.pdf)). Mono is a member of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Within Numic, it is most closely related to [Northern Paiute](northern-paiute.html) and more distantly to [Panamint](panamint.html), Shoshone (spoken in Nevada, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming), Comanche (spoken mainly in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arizona), [Kawaiisu](kawaiisu.html), and [Chemehuevi](chemehuevi.html)-Southern Paiute-Ute. The other Uto-Aztecan languages of California are [Tubatulabal](tubatulabal.html) and the Takic languages ([Cahuilla](cahuilla.html), [Cupeño](cupeno.html), [Gabrielino](gabrielino.html), [Juaneño](juaneno.html), [Kitanemuk](kitanemuk.html), [Luiseño](luiseno.html), [Serrano](serrano.html), and [Tataviam](tataviam.html)).
