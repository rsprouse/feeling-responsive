The Patwin language has two main dialects. For the first dialect, River Patwin, the traditional language area is along the Sacramento River in Colusa County. For the second dialect, Hill Patwin, the traditional language area is in the plains and foothills to the west. There is another language, Southern Patwin (traditionally spoken from central Yolo County to Suisun Bay and west far as the Napa River), which may be a third dialect, though it is very poorly attested. In pre-contact times, there were 12,500 speakers of [Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), Patwin, and [Wintu](wintu.html) together (Kroeber 1932). As of 2011, there was at least one known first-language speaker of Patwin (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation](https://www.yochadehe.org/cultural-resources/language)). Patwin is a Wintuan language; the other Wintuan languages are [Nomlaki](nomlaki.html) and [Wintu](wintu.html). Together, these languages form one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family. This group also includes Klamath-[Modoc](modoc.html), the Maiduan languages ([Konkow](konkow.html), [Maidu](maidu.html), and [Nisenan](nisenan.html)),the Miwokan languages ([Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Northern Sierra Miwok](northern-sierra-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), [Saclan](saclan.html), and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html)), the Ohlone languages ([Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Ramaytush](ramaytush.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Tamyen](tamyen.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
