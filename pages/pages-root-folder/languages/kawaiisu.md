The traditional Kawaiisu language area is in the southern Sierra Nevada, in the Tehachapi and Piute Mountains. In pre-contact times, there may have been 500 speakers of Kawaiisu (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are fewer than a dozen speakers (Golla 2011). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing language revitalization and reclamation ([Kawaiisu Language and Cultural Center](http://www.kawaiisu.org/)). Kawaiisu is a member of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Within Numic, it is most closely related to [Chemehuevi](chemehuevi.html)-Southern Paiute-Ute, spoken in southeastern California and throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Arizona. More distantly, it is related to [Panamint](panamint.html), Shoshone (spoken throughout Nevada, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming), Comanche (spoken mainly in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arizona), [Mono](mono.html), and [Northern Paiute](northern-paiute.html). The other Uto-Aztecan languages of California are [Tubatulabal](tubatulabal.html) and the Takic languages ([Cahuilla](cahuilla.html), [Cupeño](cupeno.html), [Gabrielino](gabrielino.html), [Juaneño](juaneno.html), [Kitanemuk](kitanemuk.html), [Luiseño](luiseno.html), [Serrano](serrano.html), and [Tataviam](tataviam.html)).
