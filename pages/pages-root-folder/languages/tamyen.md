The traditional Tamyen language area is to the south of San Francisco Bay. During the mission period, it was spoken at Mission Santa Clara. Tamyen is clearly attested only in a single wordlist recorded by Gregory Mengarini (printed in Powell 1877). Other wordlists exist, which may or may not represent Tamyen. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 1,200 speakers of Tamyen  (Levy 1978). However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing [language revitalization and reclamation](https://www.tamien.org/language-preservation).

Tamyen (also spelled "Tamien" and "Thamien") is an Ohlone (or "Costanoan") language, along with [Awaswas](awaswas.html), [Chalon](chalon.html), [Chochenyo](chochenyo.html), [Karkin](karkin.html), [Mutsun](mutsun.html), [Rumsen](rumsen.html), and [Ramaytush](ramaytush.html). The Ohlone languages comprise one branch of the hypothesized Penutian language family, within which they form a subgroup with the Miwokan languages ([Central Sierra Miwok](central-sierra-miwok.html), [Coast Miwok](coast-miwok.html), [Lake Miwok](lake-miwok.html), [Northern Sierra Miwok](northern-sierra-miwok.html), [Plains Miwok](plains-miwok.html), [Saclan](saclan.html), and [Southern Sierra Miwok](southern-sierra-miwok.html)). Penutian also includes Klamath-[Modoc](modoc.html), the Maiduan languages ([Konkow](konkow.html), [Maidu](maidu.html), and [Nisenan](nisenan.html)), the Wintuan languages ([Nomlaki](nomlaki.html), [Patwin](patwin.html), and [Wintu](wintu.html)), and the [Yokuts languages](yokuts.html).
