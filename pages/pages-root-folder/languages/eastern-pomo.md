The traditional Eastern Pomo language area is on the eastern side of Clear Lake, primarily along streams set back from the shore. There were five main groups centered around settlements in Big Valley (south of Lakeport), on the south shore of Clear Lake along Kelsey Creek, in Clover Valley (to the northeast of Upper Lake), along Middle Creek in Upper Lake Valley, and on the north shore of Clear Lake. In pre-contact times, the Pomoan languages together probably had around 8,000 speakers (Kroeber 1925). In the 21st century, there are only a few first-language speakers of Eastern Pomo. However, tribal members and language activists have been pursuing [language revitalization and reclamation](https://www.nijc.org/pdfs/CENY/CENY%20Pomo%20Language%20Curriculum%20Development%202013.pdf).

Eastern Pomo (also called "Clear Lake Pomo") is one of seven languages comprising the Pomoan language family; the others are [Central Pomo](central-pomo.html), [Kashaya](kashaya.html), [Northeastern Pomo](northeastern-pomo.html), [Northern Pomo](northern-pomo.html), [Southern Pomo](southern-pomo.html), and [Southeastern Pomo](southeastern-pomo.html). Together, the Pomoan languages form one branch of the hypothesized Hokan language family, the other members of which are [Chimariko](chimariko.html), [Esselen](esselen.html), [Karuk](karuk.html), the Palaihnihan languages ([Achumawi](achumawi.html) and [Atsugewi](atsugewi.html)), [Salinan](salinan.html), the Shastan languages ([Konomihu](konomihu.html), [New River Shasta](new-river-shasta.html), [Okwanuchu](okwanuchu.html), and [Shasta](shasta.html)), [Washo](washo.html), [Yana](yana.html), and the Yuman languages (Cocopa, Kiliwa, [Kumeyaay](kumeyaay.html), [Maricopa](maricopa.html), [Mojave](mojave.html), Pai, Paipai, and [Quechan](quechan.html)).
