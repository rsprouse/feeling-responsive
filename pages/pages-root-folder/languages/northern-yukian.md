The traditional Northern Yukian language area ranges from the Coast Range bordering the Sacramento Valley to Fort Bragg on the coast. It has three distinct dialects: *Yuki*, spoken in the upper drainage of the Middle Fork of the Eel River;
*Huchnom*, spoken on the lower Eel River; and *Coast Yuki*, spoken on the Pacific coast between Fort Bragg and Usal Creek. In pre-contact times, there were approximately 6,880 speakers of Yuki, 2,100 of Huchnom, and 750 of Coast Yuki (Cook 1956). In the 21st century, there are no first-language speakers (Golla 2011).
