The traditional area of the very closely related Mattole and Bear River varieties of California Dene (Athabaskan) is along the lower Mattole River and its tributaries in present-day Humboldt County, and along the Bear River (Elsasser 1978). In pre-contact times, there were approximately 2,500 speakers of Mattole and Bear River combined (Baumhoff 1958). As far as is known, there are no first-language speakers of either variety remaining in the 21st century (Golla 2011).

Mattole is a member of the Dene (Athabaskan) language family, spoken across North America with concentrations in western Canada (Dëne Suliné, Sarsi, Slave), Alaska (Ahtna, Gwich'in, Koyukon), the southwest United States (Apache, Navajo), and coastal Oregon and northern California. The other Dene languages of California are [Eel River Athabaskan](eel-river-athabaskan.html), [Hupa](hupa.html), [Kato](kato.html), and [Tolowa](tolowa.html).
