During the summer of 2021, we began a language-documentation project with speakers of the language Atchan (ISO: ebr), a Kwa language spoken in Côte d’Ivoire. We are working with speakers of Atchan (whose ethnicity, in the Atchan language, is called Tchaman) in documenting this endangered language. Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire, is built upon the traditional Tchaman homeland. French colonizers claimed the land as their own in the mid-19th century, due to its favorable location on the coast, and officially declared Abidjan a town in 1903, expelling many indigenous Tchaman people from their land. Colonial French rule, which emphasized assimilation to French culture and language, continued until 1960, at which point Côte d'Ivoire achieved independence. Abidjan, as the urban center of the country, experienced explosive population growth after independence. Today, the Tchaman people mainly live in village enclaves within the city.

Our first interactions with Atchan speakers came in 2019. Katie and professor Hannah Sande, both then at Georgetown University, briefly met with an Atchan speaker in Anono, a Tchaman village within Abidjan, on the tail end of a research trip to Côte d’Ivoire, which had been focused on working with speakers of the Kru language Guebié. Katie and Hannah confirmed some intriguing nasal harmony data presented in an earlier grammar sketch of Atchan (Bolé-Richard 1983). Following this experience and a follow-up remote elicitation session in October 2019 conducted with the same speaker, Katie was looking forward to working more on Atchan upon returning to Côte d’Ivoire in summer 2020. 

However, due to the COVID pandemic, we were unable to return to Côte d’Ivoire in 2020.  Instead, Becky and Katie both started at Berkeley in the fall of 2020, beginning grad school fully remotely. In the hopes of summer 2021 travel, Katie applied for an Oswalt Grant to return to work with the Tchaman community. Becky, who was looking to begin working on a fieldwork project, also decided to work on documenting Atchan.

With fieldwork travel still not possible that summer, we pivoted to begin fully remote fieldwork.  With Hannah’s help, we got in touch with Kouadio Timothée, an Ivoirian student who graduated with his Master of Arts in English general linguistics at Felix Houphouët Boigny University-Cocody after studying English literature and linguistics in his undergraduate.  Now he is applying for PhD studies in the US. Timothée’s native language is mainly An(d)o, but he also speaks Baoulé and other varieties of Akan languages (Agni Bona, Agni Bini, and Agni Djuablin) spoken in the regions of Iffou and Indénié-Djuablin, in the center eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire. All these local languages are part of the Kwa language group to which Atchan also belongs. Timothée has become an invaluable part of our research team by establishing contact with Atchan speakers in Anono and facilitating elicitation sessions.

In July, we began meeting 2-3 times per week with Mrs. Koutouan Evelyne and Mrs. Kouakou Jean, two Atchan speakers from Anono. Mrs. Koutouan has lived in this village since her childhood and shares a residence with her family members. As a source of economic income, she goes about her daily business of making attiéké, a staple similar to couscous made of cassava, and selling butane gas. The same goes for Mrs. Kouakou, who sells attiéké and fish at the Anono market and chicken in the evening on the roadside next to her house. Both native speakers have noted how uncommonly the Atchan language is spoken (overshadowed by French) in public spaces. Timothée has made elicitation possible by traveling to Anono for each session and connecting us to the consultants via Zoom (and by helping to translate when our French is less than perfect). Even though we are geographically located 7500 miles apart, remote elicitation has enabled us to collaborate as a team on the Atchan project, a feat which has been possible thanks to the Oswalt Grant, Zoom, and lots of dedication to the project on all sides. 

In December 2021, Katie and Hannah returned to Côte d’Ivoire for a short trip: though the trip centered mainly on reconnecting with close friends and collaborators in the Guebié-speaking community (who they had visited in their earlier 2019 trip) in the southwestern region of the country, they were able to briefly visit Anono in Abidjan. There Katie finally met Mrs. Koutouan, Mrs. Kouakou and Timothée in person, after spending dozens of hours building relationships via Zoom. The occasion was exciting for everyone involved — Mrs. Koutouan, for one, filmed the entire elicitation on her phone to share with her friends and family. The group then walked around the neighborhood: the marketplace in particular was the center of attention, as Mrs. Kouakou showed off the stall where she sells attiéké. Although only Katie was able to be there in person, Becky’s presence was certainly felt as well, as the consultants inquired in Atchan about Katie’s hɔ̃mja ‘sister.’ The chance to meet in person, however brief, felt incredibly special, as it marked the beginning of being able to translate connections made remotely into a real relationship with the Tchaman community. 

Due to the flexibility of Zoom-based elicitation, we’ve been able to meet multiple times a week for more than seven months, and have built a strong base for future work on Atchan. At the same time, we are very much looking forward to this summer, when we hope to conduct a summer research trip to work more on documenting various aspects of Atchan (Katie is working on documenting Atchan phonology, Becky on syntax and semantics; and we’ll also be joined this summer by Julianne Kapner, a sociolinguist) — and for the entire research team to finally convene together in person. On the Atchan language project, Timothée believes that this work sets the foundation for a continuing collaboration. As it evolves, he hopes it will reinforce mutual understanding and assuage any misgivings or thoughts of distrust that cloud any project that involves people from different cultures. He hopes this is the beginning of a wonderful enterprise to discover more about this beautiful language and its people. While we’re looking forward to a time when our whole team can conduct work in Anono, beginning this project remotely has given us the invaluable opportunity to create connections across the globe.
