# This action builds the CLA website and copies the files to the public
# web server when a release (e.g. tag v1.1.6-release) or prerelease
# (e.g. tag v1.1.6-prerelease) is pushed to github.

# In order for this action to work several environment variables must be
# defined as github secrets:

# DEPLOY_HOST: hostname of the public web server where the website will
#    be copied via rsync, e.g. linguistics.berkeley.edu
# DEPLOY_USER: username to be used for rsync on DEPLOY_HOST,
#    e.g. saphon_deployer
# DEPLOY_PATH_PROD: filepath on DEPLOY_HOST where the production release
#    website will be copied, e.g. /home/sites/saphon
# DEPLOY_PATH_DEV: filepath on DEPLOY_HOST where the development
#    website will be copied, e.g. /home/sites/saphon/prerelease
# GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: developer key for Google Maps API, to be inserted
#    into website code
# SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS: List of known keys for DEPLOY_HOST, as generated by e.g.
#    `ssh-keyscan linguistics.berkeley.edu`
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: private key for DEPLOY_USER on DEPLOY_HOST. The key
#    must exist in DEPLOY_USER's `authorized_keys` file on DEPLOY_HOST.
#    PEM-encoded RSA keys are known to work and can be created with e.g.
#    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM`, and the private key can then
#    be copied to DEPLOY_HOST.
